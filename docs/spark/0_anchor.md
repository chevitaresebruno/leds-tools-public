# Guide Map
The Spark Documentation is very large, and you could get lost in it. Don’t worry, here we will explain how you should read it. First, you need to know which kind of user you are...

- If you want to **USE SPARK**, check [this section](#i-want-to-use-spark);
- If you want to **IMPROVE SPARK CODE**, check [this section](#i-want-to-improve-the-spark-code).

## I Want to Use Spark

### Prerequisites
To use Spark, you must know System Analysis, at least class modeling. You can also see the following links:

- Internet Text Content:
  - [Free Online Course](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/system_analysis_and_design/system_analysis_and_design_overview.htm);
- Books:
  - Systems Analysis and Design (Howard Gould);
- Portuguese Content:
  - [Apostila de Análise de Sistemas](https://www.inf.ufes.br/~vitorsouza/falbo/Notas_Aula_Engenharia_Requisitos_Falbo_2017.pdf);

To understand the Spark-generated architecture, you will need different content for each one...

About the frontend: it will generate a LEDS internal architecture, so it will be properly explained in section [Vue Plus Vuetify](./advanced_stuffs/Architecture/generated_arch/frontend/1_vuePlusVuetfy.mdx).

If you want to understand what REST APIs are, you can also check:

## I Want to Improve the Spark Code
When dealing with Spark, you must know that there are two different source codes. The first is about the grammar specifier, called Spark, and the compiler, called SparkLib. To improve the code, you need to integrate both of them.

### Prerequisites
Here we will specify each major knowledge area you will need to know to improve the code. In each area, there are too many references. You don’t need to get all of them, just choose the ones that work best for you.

For Theoretical Principles, you will need to know about:
