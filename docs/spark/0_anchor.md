# Guide Map
The Spark Documentation is too bigger and you could be lost in it. Don't Worry, here we will tell how you should read it.

## I Want to Use Spark

### Pre-Requisits
- To use Spark you must know System Analisys; You can also see the following links:
  -  https://www.simplilearn.com/us/project-management/cbap-preparatory-course-training (pay course);
  -  Systems Analysis and Design (Book);
  -  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/system_analysis_and_design/system_analysis_and_design_overview.htm (free online course);
  -  https://www.inf.ufes.br/~vitorsouza/falbo/Notas_Aula_Engenharia_Requisitos_Falbo_2017.pdf (if you understad Portuguese);
-  To Understand the Spark Generated Architecture, you will need diferent pre-requisit...
   -  For MVC Based Architectures:
      -  https://www.devmedia.com.br/introducao-ao-padrao-mvc/29308 (if you know Portuguese);
      -  https://docs.djangoproject.com/pt-br/5.2/faq/general/ (for Django MVC);
      -  https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/spring-mvc.html (for Spring Boot)
   -  For Clean Architecture Based Architectures:
      -  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ4k1IC8GhW3GICba2dLmiTZrVPw0SthC&si=Vgn5xPDEmq1eL9mE (if you know Portuguese);
      -  Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design (book);
   -  For Minimal Api Based Architectures:
      -  TODO:
   -  Abbout the Frontend, it will generated a LEDS internal architecture, so it will be appropertly explained in [Vue Plus Vuetfy](./advanced_stuffs/Architecture/generated_arch/frontend/1_vuePlusVuetfy.mdx);
-  To Understand Rests API, you also could check:
   -  https://openaccess.uoc.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/006b62e8-a672-4169-b206-fb55dee51ff2/content (if you is a true resarcher);
   -  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-rest-rest-api-definition-for-beginners/ (to an easy read); and
-  By the way, IA is your friend.

### Suggested Route
- See [Overview](./1_overview.md) to understand the Spark principles and objectives;
- See [Instalattion](./2_installation.md) to install and use Spark;
- See [Writting a File](./how_to_use/1_writting_a_file.md) to learn how to write your first ".spark"; and
- See [Files Examples](./how_to_use/2_files_examples.md) to see files examples.

### For the Advanced Users
- See [Understaing the Generated Code Architecture](./advanced_stuffs/Architecture/generated_arch/0_introduction.mdx) to understand the generated code architecture;
    - For Clean Architecture C#, see [Clean Architecture Csharp](./advanced_stuffs/Architecture/generated_arch/backend/4_Csharp_Clean.md);
    - For MVC Django Rest Framework Architecture in Python, see [Python Architecture](./advanced_stuffs/Architecture/generated_arch/backend/2_Python.md);
    - For Minimal Api C#, see [Minimal API Csharp](./advanced_stuffs/Architecture/generated_arch/backend/3_Csharp_Minimal-API.md); and
    - For MVC Spring-Bot Architecture in Java, see [Java Architecture](./advanced_stuffs/Architecture/generated_arch/backend/1_Java.md).
